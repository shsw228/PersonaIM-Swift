# Persona IM-Swift

A reimplementation of the instant messaging app seen in Persona 5 for iOS using SwiftUI.

## Aim

This repository aims to create identical layouts in SwiftUI based on ComposeUI code.
The magic numbers that appear in the layout (almost) all come from the original source.

If the same layout can be created by referring to the same layout value, it is suggested that this value can be mutually shared.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is _not_ a functioning messaging app. It simulates a single conversation to demonstrate how such an app would be implemented in Swift UI.

Persona 5 has one of the most stylish user interfaces, including its in-game messaging app! This repository attempts to answer what it might look like if it were a real app, and how it could be built for iOS.
